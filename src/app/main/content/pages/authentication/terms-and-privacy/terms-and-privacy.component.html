<h2>Data Collection</h2>

</ul>
</div>
<p>NAWSC may receive data from you as part of the communication connection itself – the standard electronic greeting between your computer, the network, and our servers. This information often consists of network routing (where you came from), equipment information (browser type), date and time.

Some parts of the NAWSC site use cookies to collect information about visitors’ use of the Website and to facilitate return visits. The information collected from cookies is tracked to enhance security and to improve the functionality of the Website by avoiding duplicate data entry, facilitating navigation and increasing the relevance of content. Cookies on the site may collect the following information: a unique identifier, user preferences and profile information used to personalize the content that is shown and membership information to access NAWSC online communities. Some cookies used by NAWSC may remain on the user’s computer after they leave the Website but the majority are set to expire within 30 – 120 days. There may be some cookies on certain tools that may be of longer duration. Cookies also serve as a convenience to users by creating a more streamlined login process, keeping track of shopping cart additions and preserving order information between sessions. In the future, as we enable further customization of the site, cookies will help in assuring that information provided to you will be the most relevant to your needs.<br><br>
